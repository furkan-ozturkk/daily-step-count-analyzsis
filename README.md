# daily-step-count-analyzsis

## Overview
This project is a comprehensive analysis of my daily step count data, aimed at uncovering patterns and trends related to my physical activity. Using data science techniques, I will process, analyze, and visualize my step count data to identify correlations with factors such as the day of the week, and time of year. 

## Motivation
The motivation behind this project is to better understand my activity habits and how external factors like weather and scheduling impact my physical activity. By analyzing this data, I aim to gain actionable insights into improving my consistency in maintaining a healthy lifestyle.

## Dataset
The dataset for this project consists of daily step count data collected via a fitness tracker. It includes the following features:

- **Date:** The date of the recorded step count.
- **Step Count:** Total steps recorded on a given day.
- **Day of the Week:** The day of the week corresponding to each record.

## Project Objectives

1-**Data Preprocessing:**

- Clean the raw dataset by removing invalid or missing entries.
- Engineer features like day of the week, and step count ranges.

2-**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

- Identify trends in step counts across days, weeks, and months.
- Analyze the impact of external factors like exam dates or weekdays on step counts.
- Visualize distributions and trends using interactive and static plots.


## Tools and Libraries

- Python: For data processing, analysis, and modeling.
- Pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- Matplotlib/Seaborn: For static visualizations.
- Plotly: For interactive visualizations.
- Scikit-learn: For building and evaluating the predictive model.

## Deliverables

- **Data Analysis Report:** A detailed report containing the insights derived from EDA.
- **Visualizations:** Both static (PNG files) and interactive (included in a presentation).
- **Presentation:** A slide deck summarizing the project.


## Future Work
In the future, I plan to incorporate more contextual data, such as the type of activities performed (e.g., gym workouts, walking, hiking), to refine the analysis and improve model predictions.

## Conclusion

This project offers a data-driven approach to understanding and improving physical activity habits. By leveraging data science tools and techniques, I hope to uncover actionable insights and foster a healthier lifestyle.
